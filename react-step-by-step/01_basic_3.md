### âœ… **JSX â€“ What & Why?**

### **What is JSX?**

JSX (**JavaScript XML**) is a **syntax extension** for JavaScript used in **React** to write UI components in a way that looks like HTML.

ðŸ”¹ Example:

```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, JSX!</h1>;
```

### **Why Use JSX?**

âœ… **Easier to Read & Write** â€“ Looks like HTML inside JavaScript  
âœ… **Faster Rendering** â€“ Optimized by Reactâ€™s Virtual DOM  
âœ… **Prevents Injection Attacks** â€“ Secures data by escaping inputs  
âœ… **Better Debugging** â€“ More readable and structured UI code

JSX is **not required** in React, but it **makes development easier**! ðŸš€
