# **🔹 Error Boundaries in React – Interview Guide & Best Practices 🚀**

## **📌 What are Error Boundaries in React?**

An **Error Boundary** is a **special React component** that **catches JavaScript errors in its child components** during rendering, lifecycle methods, and event handlers.

✅ **Prevents crashes by catching errors at the component level.**  
✅ **Displays a fallback UI instead of breaking the entire app.**  
✅ **Enhances debugging by logging errors gracefully.**

📌 **Analogy:** Think of an Error Boundary as an **airbag in a car** – when an accident (error) happens, it prevents the entire system from failing by providing a fallback UI.

## **📌 Why Do We Need Error Boundaries?**

🚀 **Key Benefits:**  
✅ **Prevents the entire app from crashing due to one faulty component.**  
✅ **Provides a better user experience with a fallback UI.**  
✅ **Helps in logging errors to services like Sentry or Firebase.**  
✅ **Catches errors in the component tree (but not in event handlers or async functions).**

## **📌 How to Create an Error Boundary in React?**

Error Boundaries are **class components** because they use lifecycle methods (`componentDidCatch` & `getDerivedStateFromError`).

### **🔹 Step 1: Create an Error Boundary Component**

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";

class ErrorBoundary extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }

  // Updates state when an error is caught
  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  // Logs error details (can be sent to an external service)
  componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
    console.error("Caught an error:", error, errorInfo);
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return <h2>⚠️ Oops! Something went wrong.</h2>;
    }
    return this.props.children;
  }
}

export default ErrorBoundary;
```

---

### **🔹 Step 2: Wrap Components with the Error Boundary**

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ErrorBoundary from "./ErrorBoundary";
import MyComponent from "./MyComponent";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <ErrorBoundary>
      <MyComponent />
    </ErrorBoundary>
  );
};

export default App;
```

✅ Now, if `MyComponent` crashes, the `ErrorBoundary` will **catch the error** and **prevent the entire app from breaking**.

---

## **📌 Where to Use Error Boundaries?**

📌 **Use Error Boundaries at key locations in your app:**  
✅ **At the root level** – Prevent the entire app from crashing.  
✅ **Around critical components** – Like forms, authentication flows, and dashboards.  
✅ **Around third-party components** – To catch errors from external libraries.  
✅ **Inside route components** – To prevent crashes on navigation.

```jsx
<ErrorBoundary>
  <Navbar />
</ErrorBoundary>

<ErrorBoundary>
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
    <Route path="/profile" element={<Profile />} />
  </Routes>
</ErrorBoundary>
```

## **📌 Best Practices for Using Error Boundaries**

✅ **Use multiple Error Boundaries** – Different components may need different fallback UIs.  
✅ **Provide user-friendly error messages** – Don't just show "Something went wrong."  
✅ **Log errors to monitoring tools** – Use services like **Sentry, LogRocket, or Firebase**.  
✅ **Don’t use Error Boundaries for user input validation** – They are for runtime errors, not business logic.  
✅ **Combine with React Suspense** – For handling lazy-loaded components.

---

## **📌 What Error Boundaries CANNOT Catch?**

❌ **Errors inside event handlers** (Use `try...catch` inside handlers instead).  
❌ **Errors in async code (Promises, `setTimeout`, API calls, etc.).**  
❌ **Server-side rendering (SSR) errors.**

📌 **Fix for async errors:** Use `try...catch` inside async functions:

```jsx
const fetchData = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
    const data = await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Async error:", error);
  }
};
```

## **📌 Error Boundaries vs. Try-Catch vs. Suspense**

| Feature                     | Error Boundaries 🚀            | Try-Catch 🔄          | React Suspense 🎭         |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Handles UI Crashes**      | ✅ Yes                         | ❌ No                 | ✅ Yes (for lazy loading) |
| **Handles Async Errors**    | ❌ No                          | ✅ Yes                | ❌ No                     |
| **Works in Event Handlers** | ❌ No                          | ✅ Yes                | ❌ No                     |
| **SSR Support**             | ❌ No                          | ✅ Yes                | ❌ No                     |
| **Best For**                | Component-level error handling | API calls, async code | Code splitting            |
